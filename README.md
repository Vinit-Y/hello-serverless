# Hello Serverless

This project demonstrates a simple serverless application.

Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by a cloud provider. This allows you to focus on writing code and deploying applications faster.

This project was developed as part of a workshop at Global Hack Week conducted by Major League Hacking.
